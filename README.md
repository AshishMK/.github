Community Health Files Repository
=================================

This repository contains a set of organization-wide community health files. These files serve as
organization-wide defaults for all repositories within their organization
([details](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file)).

In our case, the CONTRIBUTING file will be included for any repos missing the file. Please note, the LICENSE and README.md
files are not supported. They're just included in our repo per our requirements.
